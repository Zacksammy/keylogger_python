# keylogger_python
i created a simple straight forward keylogger for you to try as a little project i created

P.S this is for educational purposes only


to install ,i have a setup in pynput which you can use to install it

or 
pip install pynput(this is actaully easier)

after that create your logger.pyw
the rest is pretty straight forward
